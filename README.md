This project is consisted of two parts: Python programming and Wireshark exercise.

PROJECT SUBMISSION

You are responsible for the content of your submitted zip file. You should double-check to ensure your submitted zip file contain all required files and their contents are what you intend to submit. Grading will be based solely on your submission in Canvas. To enforce fairness for everyone submit your work in Canvas only. Submissions outside Canvas will not be accepted. Canvas is setup to only accept .zip file type.

PART 1: PYTHON PROGRAMMING ‚Äì A SIMPLE WEB SERVER

In this lab, you will learn the basics of socket programming for TCP connections in Python: how to create a socket, bind it to a specific address and port, as well as send and receive a HTTP packet. You will also learn some basics of HTTP header format.

You will develop a web server that handles one HTTP request at a time. Your web server should accept and parse the HTTP request, get the requested file from the server‚Äôs file system, create an HTTP response message consisting of the requested file preceded by header lines, and then send the response directly to the client. If the requested file is not present in the server, the server should send an HTTP ‚Äú404 Not Found‚Äù message back to the client.

CODE

A skeleton python code is provided with the assignment. You are to complete the skeleton code. The places where you need to fill in code are marked with #Fill in start and #Fill in end . Each place may require one or more lines of code.

Note:

ÔÇ∑ Use the latest Python release (Python 3)

ÔÇ∑ Useportnumber45678foryourwebserverport

RUNNING THE SERVER

Put the provided HTML files (index.html, page2.html) in the same directory that the server code is in. Run the server program.

On the same computer open a browser and enter the URL below:

http://localhost:45678/index.html

Note the use of the port number after the colon.

The browser should then display the contents of index.html. If you omit ‚Äú:45678‚Äù, the browser will assume port 80 and you will get the web page from the server only if your server is listening at port 80.

Then try to get a file that is not present at the server (for example, click on the hyperlink Page 1 on the Main Page). You should get a ‚Äú404 Not Found‚Äù message.

SUBMISSION CONTENT

In your pdf file report, create a section called Part 1 ‚Äì Python Programming Web Server. This portion on your report shall include the following items: Python Code listing and Browser Screen captures.

PYTHON CODE LISTING

Include as text the listing of your Python server code in your pdf report. You must use Courier New or any equivalent monospace font such as consolas or TlwgTypewriter, size 10 for the code listing. The use of these monospace font is to clearly show the indentations in your code.

In addition, also submit your Python server code file using the naming convention such as yourname_p1.py to be included in your report zip file.

BROWSER SCREEN CAPTURES

Include the screen captures of your client browser, verifying that you actually receive the contents of the HTML file from the server. Make sure the URL is clearly shown and legible.

Provide the three screen captures showing the below:

<ol>
<li>The Main Page</li>
<li>The 404 Not Found (when clicked on Page 1 link on the Main page)</li>
<li>The Page 2</li>
</ol>
All screen captures must be clear and legible to get full credit.

PART 2: ANALYZING HTTP MESSAGES USING WIRESHARK

You are going to use Wireshark to capture and analyze HTTP messages.

SUBMISSION CONTENT

In your pdf file report, create a section called Part 2 ‚Äì Analyzing HTTP messages using Wireshark. Provide the answers for the 19 questions below.

THE BASIC HTTP GET/RESPONSE INTERACTION

Let‚Äôs begin our exploration of HTTP by downloading a very simple HTML file ‚Äì one that is very short, and contains no embedded objects. Do the following:

<ul>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Start up your web browser.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;StartuptheWiresharkpacketsniffer,asdescribedintheIntroductorylab(butdon‚Äôtyet begin packet capture). Enter ‚Äúhttp‚Äù (just the letters, not the quotation marks) in the display- filter-specification window, so that only captured HTTP messages will be displayed later in the packet-listing window. (We‚Äôre only interested in the HTTP protocol here, and don‚Äôt want to see the clutter of all captured packets).</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Wait a bit more than one minute (we‚Äôll see why shortly), and then begin Wireshark packet capture.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Enterthefollowingtoyourbrowser http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file1.html Your browser should display the very simple, one-line HTML file.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Stop Wireshark packet capture.

Your Wireshark window should look similar to the window shown in Figure 1.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Figure 1: Wireshark Display after http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/ HTTP-wireshark- file1.html has been retrieved by your browser.

The example in Figure 1 shows in the packet-listing window that two HTTP messages were captured: the GET message (from your browser to the gaia.cs.umass.edu web server) and the response message from the server to your browser. The packet-contents window shows details of the selected message (in this case the HTTP OK message, which is highlighted in the packet-listing window). Recall that since the HTTP message was carried inside a TCP segment, which was carried inside an IP datagram, which was carried within an Ethernet frame, Wireshark displays the Frame, Ethernet, IP, and TCP packet information as well. We want to minimize the amount of non-HTTP data displayed (we‚Äôre interested in HTTP here, and will be investigating these other protocols is later labs), so make sure the boxes at the far left of the Frame, Ethernet, IP and TCP information have a plus sign or a right-pointing triangle (which means there is hidden, undisplayed information), and the HTTP line has a minus sign or a down-pointing triangle (which means that all information about the HTTP message is displayed).

(Note: You should ignore any HTTP GET and response for favicon.ico. If you see a reference to this file, it is your browser automatically asking the server if it (the server) has a small icon file that should be displayed next to the displayed URL in your browser. We‚Äôll ignore references to this pesky file in this lab.).

ANSWER THE QUESTIONS

By looking at the information in the HTTP GET and response messages, answer the following questions. When answering the following questions, you should include the screen capture of the GET and response messages and indicate where in the message you‚Äôve found the information that answers the following questions.

<ol>
<li>Is your browser running HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1? What version of HTTP is the server running?</li>
<li>Whatlanguages(ifany)doesyourbrowserindicatethatitcanaccepttotheserver?</li>
<li>WhatistheIPaddressofyourcomputer?Ofthegaia.cs.umass.eduserver?</li>
<li>Whatisthestatuscodereturnedfromtheservertoyourbrowser?</li>
<li>WhenwastheHTMLfilethatyouareretrievinglastmodifiedattheserver?</li>
<li>Howmanybytesofcontentarebeingreturnedtoyourbrowser?</li>
<li>By inspecting the raw data in the packet content window, do you see any headers within the
data that are not displayed in the packet-listing window? If so, name one.
</li>
</ol>
In your answer to question 5 above, you might have been surprised to find that the document you just retrieved was last modified within a minute before you downloaded the document. That‚Äôs because (for this particular file), the gaia.cs.umass.edu server is setting the file‚Äôs last-modified time to be the current time, and is doing so once per minute. Thus, if you wait a minute between accesses, the file will appear to have been recently modified, and hence your browser will download a ‚Äúnew‚Äù copy of the document.

THE HTTP CONDITIONAL GET/RESPONSE INTERACTION

Recall from Section 2.2.5 of the text, that most web browsers perform object caching and thus perform a conditional GET when retrieving an HTTP object. Before performing the steps below, make sure your browser‚Äôs cache is empty. (To do this under Firefox, select Tools-&gt;Clear Recent History and check the Cache box, or for Internet Explorer, select Tools-&gt;Internet Options-&gt;Delete File; these actions will remove cached files from your browser‚Äôs cache.) Now do the following:

<ul>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Start up your web browser, and make sure your browser‚Äôs cache is cleared, as discussed above.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;StartuptheWiresharkpacketsniffer</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;EnterthefollowingURLintoyourbrowser http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file2.html Your browser should display a very simple five-line HTML file.</li>

</ol>
RETRIEVING LONG DOCUMENTS

In our examples thus far, the documents retrieved have been simple and short HTML files. Let‚Äôs next see what happens when we download a long HTML file. Do the following:

<ul>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Start up your web browser, and make sure your browser‚Äôs cache is cleared, as discussed above.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;StartuptheWiresharkpacketsniffer</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;EnterthefollowingURLintoyourbrowser http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file3.html Your browser should display the rather lengthy US Bill of Rights.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;StopWiresharkpacketcapture,andenter‚Äúhttp‚Äùinthedisplay-filter-specificationwindow, so that only captured HTTP messages will be displayed.
In the packet-listing window, you should see your HTTP GET message, followed by a multiple- packet TCP response to your HTTP GET request. This multiple-packet response deserves a bit of explanation. Recall from Section 2.2 (see Figure 2.9 in the text) that the HTTP response message consists of a status line, followed by header lines, followed by a blank line, followed by the entity body. In the case of our HTTP GET, the entity body in the response is the entire requested HTML file. In our case here, the HTML file is rather long, and at 4500 bytes is too large to fit in one TCP packet. The single HTTP response message is thus broken into several pieces by TCP, with each piece being contained within a separate TCP segment (see Figure 1.24 in the text). In recent versions of Wireshark, Wireshark indicates each TCP segment as a separate packet, and the fact that the single HTTP response was fragmented across multiple TCP packets is indicated by the ‚ÄúTCP segment of a reassembled PDU‚Äù in the Info column of the Wireshark display. Earlier versions of Wireshark used the ‚ÄúContinuation‚Äù phrase to indicated that the entire content of an HTTP message was broken across multiple TCP segments.. We stress here that there is no ‚ÄúContinuation‚Äù message in HTTP!

ANSWER THE QUESTIONS

<ol start="12">
<li>How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send? Which packet number in the trace contains the GET message for the Bill or Rights?</li>
<li>Which packet number in the trace contains the status code and phrase associated with the response to the HTTP GET request?</li>
<li>What is the status code and phrase in the response?</li>
<li>How many data-containing TCP segments were needed to carry the single HTTP response
and the text of the Bill of Rights?
</li>
</ol>
HTML DOCUMENTS WITH EMBEDDED OBJECTS

Now that we‚Äôve seen how Wireshark displays the captured packet traffic for large HTML files, we can look at what happens when your browser downloads a file with embedded objects, i.e., a file that includes other objects (in the example below, image files) that are stored on another server(s).

Do the following:

<ul>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Start up your web browser, and make sure your browser‚Äôs cache is cleared, as discussed above.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;StartuptheWiresharkpacketsniffer</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;EnterthefollowingURLintoyourbrowser http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file4.html

Your browser should display a short HTML file with two images. These two images are referenced in the base HTML file. That is, the images themselves are not contained in the HTML; instead the URLs for the images are contained in the downloaded HTML file. As discussed in the textbook, your browser will have to retrieve these logos from the indicated websites. Ourpublisher‚Äôslogoisretrievedfromthegaia.cs.umass.eduwebsite.Theimage of the cover for our 5th edition (one of our favorite covers) is stored at the caite.cs.umass.edu server. (These are two different web servers inside cs.umass.edu).</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;StopWiresharkpacketcapture,andenter‚Äúhttp‚Äùinthedisplay-filter-specificationwindow, so that only captured HTTP messages will be displayed.
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="16">
<li>How many HTTP GET request messages did your browser send? To which Internet addresses were these GET requests sent?</li>
<li>Can you tell whether your browser downloaded the two images serially, or whether they were downloaded from the two web sites in parallel? Explain.

HTTP AUTHENTICATION

Finally, let‚Äôs try visiting a web site that is password-protected and examine the sequence of HTTP message exchanged for such a site. The URL

http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/protected_pages/HTTP-wireshark-file5.html is password protected. The username is ‚Äúwireshark-students‚Äù (without the quotes), and the password is ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù (again, without the quotes). So let‚Äôs access this ‚Äúsecure‚Äù password-protected site. Do the following:

<ul>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;Make sure your browser‚Äôs cache is cleared, as discussed above, and close down your browser. Then, start up your browser</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;StartuptheWiresharkpacketsniffer</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;EnterthefollowingURLintoyourbrowser http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/protected_pages/HTTP-wireshark-file5.html Type the requested user name and password into the pop up box.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;StopWiresharkpacketcapture,andenter‚Äúhttp‚Äùinthedisplay-filter-specificationwindow, so that only captured HTTP messages will be displayed later in the packet-listing window.
Now let‚Äôs examine the Wireshark output. You might want to first read up on HTTP authentication by reviewing the easy-to-read material on ‚ÄúHTTP Access Authentication Framework‚Äù at http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$2159

ANSWER THE QUESTIONS
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="18">
<li>What is the server‚Äôs response (status code and phrase) in response to the initial HTTP GET message from your browser?</li>
<li>When your browser‚Äôs sends the HTTP GET message for the second time, what new field is included in the HTTP GET message?</li>
</ol>
The username (wireshark-students) and password (network) that you entered are encoded in the string of characters (d2lyZXNoYXJrLXN0dWRlbnRzOm5ldHdvcms=) following the ‚ÄúAuthorization: Basic‚Äù header in the client‚Äôs HTTP GET message. While it may appear that your username and password are encrypted, they are simply encoded in a format known as Base64 format. The username and password are not encrypted! To see this, go to http://www.motobit.com/util/base64-decoder-encoder.asp and enter the base64-encoded string d2lyZXNoYXJrLXN0dWRlbnRz and decode. Voila! You have translated from Base64 encoding to ASCII encoding, and thus should see your username! To view the password, enter the remainder of the string Om5ldHdvcms= and press decode. Since anyone can download a tool like Wireshark and sniff packets (not just their own) passing by their network adaptor, and anyone can translate from Base64 to ASCII (you just did it!), it should be clear to you that simple passwords on WWW sites are not secure unless additional measures are taken.
